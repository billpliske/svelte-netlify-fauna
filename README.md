# Svelte / Netlify serverless / GraphQL / Fauna DB
I was determined to get this one working, as I was tired of dealing with back-end servers (even though Dokku is awesome), and paying the monthly fee for something I never took full advantage of.

## General steps
In a nutshell ...

### Svelte
1. To install Svelte: `npx degit sveltejs/template my-project-name`
2. For learning Svelte, I highly recommend Their main site (https://svelte.dev/), and also NetNinja's Svelte Tutorial for Beginners (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zojEMeQGGHs&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hlbrVO_2QFVqVPhlZmz7tO)

### Netlify serverless
more to come, soon.

### GraphQL on Fauna DB
more to come, soon
